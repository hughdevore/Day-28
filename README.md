<h1># Day-28 & Weekend</h1>
<h2>at The Iron Yard</h2>

<h2>Goal:</h2>
The goal for the Day-28 homework was to build out a web app that could utilize a backend server to store objects {imageURL: 'url', caption: 'caption'}. These objects would be stored and templated into an HTML form by utilizing the angular javascript framework and it's impressive methods.

<h2>Update:</h2>
I have completed the project in record time (about 1.5 hrs of planning and 5 hrs of programming), however this was mainly due to angular's impressively concise syntax. I plan on continuing to work on adding the following features before the end of the program in order to sharpen the associated skills.

<ul>
  <li>Add ng-cloak to the app module in order to remove the flicker upon rendering the templated collection objects.</li>
  <li>Add a setTimeout to the get method in order to have the templated HTML figure element templated without having to reload the page.</li>
  <li>add the ability to edit a collection by altering the caption to a html textarea</li>
</ul>
